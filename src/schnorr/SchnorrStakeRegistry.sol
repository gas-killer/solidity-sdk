/// @notice Stake registry for the **aggregate Schnorr** quorum scheme — the Schnorr
///         equivalent of EigenLayer's `ECDSAStakeRegistry`. Instead of verifying `N`
///         individual signatures, it maintains a watermark-snapshotted **aggregate**
///         operator public key `X_all = Σ X_i` (a single current value, not a per-block
///         history) and verifies a single aggregate signature against
///         `X_agg = X_all − Σ non-signers` in constant gas.
///
/// @dev Mirrors the "aggressive snapshot" registry-cache design from the ECDSA gas-opt
///      work (service #311): a `_effectiveBlock` watermark records the last operator-set
///      mutation, and verification is **fail-closed** — it requires
///      `refBlock >= _effectiveBlock` so the cached aggregate/weights are guaranteed equal
///      to their historical values at `refBlock`. Plain (linear) key aggregation is safe
///      here only because registration requires a **proof of possession**, which defeats
///      rogue-key attacks (the same guarantee `BLSApkRegistry` enforces for BLS).
///
///      This is a self-contained implementation (no EigenLayer base classes) so the whole
///      verify + subtraction + threshold path is unit-testable; production would layer the
///      operator/AVS registration lifecycle on top, exactly as `ECDSAStakeRegistry` does.
///
///      **The operator set must be quiescent relative to a signing round.** Because only the
///      current aggregate is stored, every operator-set mutation invalidates any signature an
///      off-chain round has already assembled against the prior set — see `isValidSignature` for
///      the two ways that surfaces. Registration and deregistration are equally affected. The
///      cost is a retry, not a soundness risk: the failure mode is a rejected signature, never
///      acceptance of one that no current-set quorum endorsed.
///
///      `announceRegister` / `announceDeregister` exist to make that quiescence checkable rather
///      than assumed. A change announced now applies only after `noticeWindow` blocks, so
///      `nextPossibleMutationBlock()` tells an off-chain round how long the set it assembled
///      against will remain the set that verifies it. `registerOperator` and
///      `deregisterOperator` bypass the window for bootstrap and emergencies and emit
///      `ForcedMutation`; consumers should treat that event, and any
///      `OperatorRegistered` / `OperatorDeregistered` without a preceding announcement, as
///      "re-snapshot required".
///
///      A mutation also changes *what counts as* a quorum, because the threshold is measured
///      against the current `totalWeight`. Removing an operator can turn a signature holding
///      less than the threshold share of the old set into a valid quorum of the smaller one —
///      correctly, since the remaining signers do carry that share. What binds a signature to
///      one specific signer set is the aggregate match (`X_all − Σ non-signers` must equal the
///      key that signed), not the watermark: advancing `effectiveBlock` does not restrict which
///      quorums are acceptable, it guarantees the cached aggregate and weights are the ones in
///      force at `refBlock` so the registry never answers for a snapshot it no longer holds.
