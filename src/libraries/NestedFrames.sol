///         one quorum signature over a Merkle root authorizes every frame of a call tree.
/// @dev A tree's leaves are an expiry leaf followed by one leaf per frame in execution order.
///      Internal nodes use OpenZeppelin's sorted-pair keccak. Every leaf is a sha256 digest
///      computed here from typed fields, so callers never hand in a leaf hash and an internal
///      node can never be presented as a leaf.
///
///      Three leaf types:
///        - root leaf:   today's single-transition digest, unchanged, so a consumer settled
///                       without nesting signs exactly what it signed before;
///        - nested leaf: a callee frame, binding chain, contract, caller, value and index;
///        - expiry leaf: the block after which neither the root nor any frame may settle.
///      The nested and expiry tags are keccak-derived words in the first slot of their
///      preimages, where the root leaf carries a transition index, so no preimage of one type
///      can equal a preimage of another.
