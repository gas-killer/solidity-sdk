/// @notice EIP-1153 transient-storage reentrancy guard that doubles as an
///         "in transition" latch external contracts can query.
/// @dev Two holes in the unguarded settlement path, one mechanism:
///
///      1. **Reentrancy.** `StateChangeHandlerLib`'s `CALL` update forwards all remaining
///         gas to an arbitrary target *mid-transition* — after `trackState` has already
///         bumped the counter and before the transition's later updates have executed. A
///         re-entrant `verifyAndUpdate` carrying transition N+1's valid quorum signature
///         would pass the transition-index check and interleave N+1's updates inside N.
///         `guardTransition` makes the re-entrant call revert instead.
///
///      2. **Midway state.** During a `CALL` update the called contract observes storage
///         that never existed per the signed semantics: the transition counter already
///         shows N+1 while only a prefix of transition N's updates have landed. The quorum
///         signed the *final* post-transition state, not this intermediate one. The same
///         transient flag is exposed as `inTransition()`, so integrators reading a Gas
///         Killer contract can fail closed (revert or fall back) while a transition is
///         being applied, for one warm TLOAD (~100 gas) paid by the reader.
///
///      Transient storage clears automatically at the end of the transaction, so the
///      guard costs ~3 transient ops (~300 gas) per guarded call and never leaves a
///      dirty storage slot behind. Requires an EVM with EIP-1153 (Cancun or later).
